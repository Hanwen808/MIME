# Network Measurement Applications

This is a Python implementation for MIME in multi-spread measurement, superhost detection, and super k-persistent spread measurement.

## Project Structure

- **MIME_Supercube.ipynb**: The implementation of MIME for four different types of flow spread measurements. 
- **MIME_three_superhost.ipynb**:	The implementation of MIME for super host detection. 
- **MIME_three-KPSE.ipynb**: The recording process of super k-persistent spread measurement. 
- **supercube_solve_kpse.ipynb**: The estimation process of super k-persistent spread measurement. 

## Requirements

- Python 3
- numpy >= 1.21.6; matplotlib >= 3.2.1
