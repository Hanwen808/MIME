# Data Description
We choose the CAIDA 2019 first minute dataset for our experiment. Since the four-task and six-task datasets are large, please download them through the url https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset/.
In the four-task cardinality measurement, each stream item is modeled as: (src, dst, sport, dport); in the six-task cardinality measurement, each stream item is modeled as: (src, dst, sport, dport, prot).
